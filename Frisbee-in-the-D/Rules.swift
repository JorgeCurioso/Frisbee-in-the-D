    let rule1 = "Frisbee golf follows the same guidelines as disc golf or regular golf. A course is laid out in a group of holes, and each hole has a starting point (tee) and ending point (a basket in disc golf, a hole or pin in regular golf). \n\nEach hole has an estimated number of strokes (referred to as 'par' for the hole) to reach the pin from each hole's teebox. Whether a player reaches that goal in fewer or more attemps is what puts them over or under par."
    let rule2 = "This course is slightly different than a a disc golf course in that it is smaller, encourages the use of a regular frisbee, and uses landmarks as pins for each hole. For example, to complete hole 2 players must hit a designated tree-trunk, hole 5 requires landing the frisbee on a tree stump, and on hole 6 users must throw the frisbee through the large 'A' in the middle of the park. Be ready to exercise a little creativity!"
    let rule3 = "Players may throw the frisbee however they choose: forehand, backhand, hammer-throw, whatever goes!"
    let rule4 = "The concept of an out-of-bounds is the last piece of the puzzle. If a frisbee goes into the road during play, it is considered out-of-bounds. To continue play, pick up the disc (when no cars are in the road!), add a stroke to your score, and continue play from the closest point in-bounds."
    let rule5 = "Please be considerate of others enjoying a day at the park, be mindful of the road and traffic, but above all, HAVE FUN!"
